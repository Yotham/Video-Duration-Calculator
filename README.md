Calculator I made while procrastinating studying for finals, it takes in video duration in minutes, i.e 20 minutes and 10 seconds would be 20.10
You can enter as many videos as you would like and then hit convert and it will output the time it would take to watch them at your desired
playback speed in hours -- minutes -- seconds format. Orginal use was for calculating how long it was going to take me to catch up on lectures.
